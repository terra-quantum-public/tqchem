This applies in particular the software mentioned in Annex "Open Source Software Components".
Section 4. Free Use
Terra Quantum offers the use of the Licensed Product for Non-Commercial Academic Purposes free of charge to the Licensee.
Section 5. Third Party Rights
(1) Notices. Each Party shall immediately notify the other Party in writing if a third party claims that the provision of the Licensed Product to the Licensee violates its rights.
Insofar as a third party asserts that the provision of the Licensed Product to the Licensee infringes its rights, Terra Quantum will examine this. Terra Quantum is entitled to defend the claims asserted by the third party out of court and in court. The Licensee undertakes not to intervene in the legal defense of Terra Quantum and to support Terra Quantum to a reasonable extent in defending the claims asserted by the third party, in particular by informing Terra Quantum about the communication of the Licensee with the third party.

(2) The Recipient is obliged to,
a) to treat confidential information of the disclosing Party as business secrets and to protect it from disclosure to third parties by means of confidentiality measures appropriate under the circumstances, taking into account the state of the art, and

dd) to advisors of the Recipient who are legally obligated to maintain confidentiality by virtue of their profession (in particular lawyers, auditors or tax advisors), insofar as this is necessary for the advisor to advise the Recipient (including in the context of due diligence or the execution of a transaction) and the advisor is not released by the Recipient from its obligation to maintain confidentiality.
c) The Recipient may disclose confidential information of the disclosing Party to companies affiliated with it within the meaning of Sections 15 et seq. German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and persons it uses to fulfill its obligations (hereinafter "Vicarious Agents", e.g. employees or subcontractors of the Recipient) and make it accessible to them,
aa) to the extent that the disclosure or making available of the respective confidential information is necessary for the achievement of the purpose or for the contractual implementation of agreements between the Parties (need-to-know principle) and
bb) insofar as the affiliated companies within the meaning of �� 15 et seq. German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Vicarious Agents are obligated to maintain secrecy at least in a comparable manner to the Recipient, whereby such an obligation to employees of the Recipient may also be effected by the respective employment contract and supplementary instructions of the Recipient to its employees and the obligation to maintain secrecy must continue to exist without time limitation even after termination of the employment contract.

b) destroy it without undue delay upon request of the disclosing Party and subsequently confirm to the disclosing Party without undue delay and in writing that the destruction has been carried out.
The obligations under sentence 1 shall not apply - notwithstanding the continuing obligation to maintain confidentiality,
a) insofar and as long as the confidential information is subject to an obligation or authorization of the recipient to store or otherwise retain it, or also
b) insofar and as long as the Recipient electronically stores the confidential information due to technically and organizationally necessary routine data backups (e.g. as a temporary data backup on a data carrier of the Recipient).
As far and as soon as the legal obligations or authorizations of the Recipient no longer exist and the data backup is also no longer technically and organizationally necessary, the obligations pursuant to sentence 1 shall apply accordingly, with the proviso that the Recipient shall be obligated to destroy the data without undue delay pursuant to sentence 1 letter b) even without a request by the disclosing Party.

(6) The Recipient shall have no right of retention against the claims for surrender or destruction of confidential information of the disclosing Party.

Annex "Service Description"

Software Overview
This software package provides access to a suite of advanced algorithms in a binary format, distributed as part of a downloadable software package. The core components include:
* TQ SDK (client): A lightweight wrapper for API access, with integrated optional authentication and identity services.
* Encrypted Algorithm Binary: The binary file contains the algorithms and the API to access them, including capabilities to submit constraints, hyperparameters, and vector-based objective functions.
Access to the algorithms and APIs requires:
* A valid license key or secret, provided by Terra Quantum.
* Authentication to decrypt the binary on demand, using the appropriate API commands.
Technical Service Description
The service requires the Licensee to integrate and maintain the following components in their infrastructure:
1. TQ SDK Installation:
o Our SDK facilitates convenient interaction with the local algorithm binaries and also supports authentication with our online services, when required. The algorithm binary, downloaded from our secure portal, requires a valid license key, which the Licensee obtains through their authenticated access to the portal.

2. Algorithm Binary:
o The encrypted binary file contains the algorithms, which are unlocked and decrypted on demand once a valid license key, provided by Terra Quantum, is authenticated.
o License keys are issued via an automated licensing system, enabling secure access to the algorithms.
o Upon successful authentication, API calls are used to submit constraints, hyperparameters, and vector-based objective functions.
o License keys control the level of access, validity period, and usage scope, ensuring compliance with non-commercial academic purposes.

System Requirements of the Licensee
To ensure proper functioning of the software package, the Licensee must meet the following minimum system requirements:
 Operating System:
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or higher
* CentOS 8 or higher
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or higher
* Other Linux distributions compatible with GCP infrastructure may be supported but must meet the same general system requirements

Hardware:
* Minimum of 16 CPU cores for computational tasks.
* Optional GPU support is available for accelerated performance (NVIDIA Tesla or A100 series recommended).

Cloud/on-premise Support:
* While Terra Quantum runs/offers these algorithms at scale in the cloud, the software can also run on static resources in local environments.
* Orchestration software is recommended for managing containers and workloads at scale, but they are not required for local or smaller-scale deployments.
* Static infrastructure or virtualized environments (VMs) that match the reference setup.
* Adequate storage to handle the encrypted binaries and related data.
* Permissions within the network (firewall, protocols, etc.)
Licensing & Authentication
The software package requires a valid license key, provided by Terra Quantum, to unlock the algorithm binaries. The Licensee is responsible for ensuring that:
* The license key is kept secure and is not shared with unauthorized parties. (recommendation: robust secrets management application)
* Proper authentication protocols are in place to handle access and decryption.
Maintenance & Updates
Algorithm binaries, SDK updates, and relevant API changes may be updated and made available via the download portal or artifact registry. Licensees are responsible for ensuring compatibility with newer versions. For the latest system requirements and technical documentation, please refer to the documentation.
Specification if Affiliates are Included
Affiliates may use the Licensed Product if explicitly authorized in the Agreement. In such cases, Affiliates must comply with the same system and security requirements as the Licensee.
